    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>
      Young Sophie Hatter is cursed by the Witch of the Waste, and turns into an
      old hag. Ashamed of how she looks, she flees into the hills where a moving
      castle roams the hills. It is said to belong to the young and handsome
      wizard Howl, who has a bad reputation. Within the castle, Sophie befriends
      the fire demon Calcifer, who promises to help her become young again. One
      catch: she must help Calcifer to be free of Howl, and Calcifer cannot tell
      her how. However, Sophie agrees to stay and try to find out about the
      contract through other ways. Still, Howl can see that Sophie is under a
      spell like Calcifer can, and he falls in love with her for who she is and
      not for what she looks like. Sophie manages to bring life to the moving
      castle, and she helps Howl to face his former tutor, Madame Suliman.
